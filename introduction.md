1, Introduction

  * XML stands for Extensible Markup Language.
  * Designed to **`store`** and **`transport`** data.
  * XML was designed to be both **`human-`** and **`machine-`** readable.
  
2, Exmaples

```
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <note>
    <to>ZW</to>
    <from>CF</from>
    <heading>Reminder</heading>
    <body>Don't forget we meet this weekend!</body>
  </note>
```

3, Why study XML

 * Play important roles in IT systems.
 * Have a good understanding of it.
 * Also basic understanding for
  * Javascript
  * HTML

4, XML Does **NOT** Do anything!

 Just information wrapped in tags, someone must write a piece of software to send, receive, store or display it.
 
5, Different between HTML and XML

 * GOAL:
  * XML designed to **CARRY** data - with focus on what data is
  * HTML designed to **DISPLAY** data - with focus on how data looks
  * XML tags are NOT pre\-defined like HTML tags are

6, XML does not use pre\-defined tags.

 * tags are `invented` by the author of the XML document.
 * HTML works with pre-defined tags like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<table>` etc.
 * with XML, author must define both the tags and the document structure.

7, XML is **Extensible**

 The way XML is constructed, older version of the application can still work!
 
8, XML simplifies things


> - data sharing
> - data transport
> - platform changes
> - data availability


 * Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. Exchanging data between incompatible systems (or upgrade systems) is a time\-consuming task for web\-developer. Large amounts of data must be converted, and incompatible data often lost.
 * XML stores data plain text format. this provides a software- and hardware- independent way of storing, transporting and sharing data.
 * XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.
 * Data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines".
